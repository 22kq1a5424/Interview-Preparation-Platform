                        Explain Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code. Key concepts include:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class/object), hiding internal details.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> A mechanism where a new class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass).</li>
                            <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The ability of an object to take on many forms, often meaning a single interface can be used for different data types.</li>
                            <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.</li>
                        </ul></p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">
                        What is the difference between a `stack` and a `queue`?
                        <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Both are linear data structures, but they differ in how elements are added and removed:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out):</strong> Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the "top." Think of a stack of plates. The last plate added is the first one removed. Operations: Push (add), Pop (remove), Peek (view top).</li>
                            <li><strong>Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out):</strong> Elements are added at one end (rear/tail) and removed from the other end (front/head). Think of a line of people. The first person in line is the first one served. Operations: Enqueue (add), Dequeue (remove), Front/Peek (view front).</li>
                        </ul></p>

                        What is a database index and why is it used?
                        <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A database index is a data structure (like a B-tree or hash table) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It's similar to the index in a book.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Why it's used:</strong>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Faster Queries:</strong> Instead of scanning the entire table (full table scan), the database can quickly locate the required data using the index.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Speeds up `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Can enforce uniqueness constraints on columns.</li>
                        </ul>
                        However, indexes come with overhead: they require storage space and can slow down data modification operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) because the index also needs to be updated.</p>

                        Explain the concept of 'concurrency' in programming.
                        <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Concurrency in programming refers to the ability of different parts of a program or system to execute independently or out of order. It's about dealing with many things at once.
                        <br><br>
                        Key aspects:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Threads/Processes:</strong> Programs can be broken down into multiple threads or processes that run seemingly simultaneously.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parallelism vs. Concurrency:</strong>
                                <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-8 mt-1">
                                    <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Deals with *many tasks at once* (even if switching between them on a single core).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Deals with *many tasks simultaneously* (requires multiple cores/processors).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Concurrency introduces challenges like race conditions, deadlocks, and starvation, requiring synchronization mechanisms (locks, semaphores, mutexes) to ensure data integrity and correct execution.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                        What is REST API?
                        <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs are a way for two computer systems to communicate over HTTP in a stateless manner.
                        <br><br>
                        Key principles of REST:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Stateless:</strong> Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand the request. The server doesn't store client context between requests.</li>
                            <li><strong>Client-Server:</strong> Clear separation of concerns between the client and server.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cacheable:</strong> Responses should explicitly or implicitly define themselves as cacheable to prevent clients from requesting the same resource multiple times.</li>
                            <li><strong>Uniform Interface:</strong> A consistent way to interact with resources (e.g., using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</li>
                            <li><strong>Layered System:</strong> Intermediaries (proxies, load balancers) can be inserted between client and server without affecting their interactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        REST APIs typically use JSON or XML for data exchange.</p>

                        <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS encryption. It ensures data transferred between your browser and a website is encrypted and authenticated.
                        <br><br>
                        Key steps:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>SSL/TLS Handshake:</strong> When you connect to an HTTPS website, a handshake occurs:
                                <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-8 mt-1">
                                    <li>Your browser sends a "Client Hello" with supported SSL/TLS versions and cipher suites.</li>
                                    <li>The server responds with a "Server Hello," selecting a version and cipher suite, and sends its SSL certificate.</li>
                                    <li>Your browser verifies the certificate's authenticity (checking the Certificate Authority, expiration, domain match).</li>
                                    <li>If valid, the browser generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it with the server's public key from the certificate, and sends it to the server.</li>
                                    <li>Both client and server then use this pre-master secret to generate a symmetric session key.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> All subsequent communication during the session is encrypted using this fast symmetric session key. This protects data from eavesdropping and tampering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> The SSL certificate verifies the server's identity, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
